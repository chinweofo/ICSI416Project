# Computer Networking: Implementation of TCP and UDP

## Project Purpose

This project in Computer Networking involved building both a client and server from the ground up. The main objective was to implement two distinct file transfer protocols—**TCP** and **UDP with Stop-and-Wait**—and evaluate their performance when transferring files over a network connection.
