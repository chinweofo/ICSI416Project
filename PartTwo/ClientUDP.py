Purpose: UDP Socket Programming Project (Client Side)

This script acts as a client for uploading and downloading files
to/from a server using basic file transfer commands (`put`, `get`, and `quit`).

All communication is done over UDP sockets using a stop-and-wait protocol
to ensure reliable transfer of file data.

Usage:
    python clientUDP.py <port> <IP Address>
    Example:
        python clientUDP.py 12345 127.0.0.1

Commands:
    - put <filename> : Uploads a file to the server.
    - get <filename> : Downloads a file from the server.
    - quit           : Exits the client program.

Notes:
    - The server stores uploaded files in directories based on the client's IP address.
    - File transfers are done in chunks (default 1000 bytes).
    - Each chunk requires an ACK for reliable delivery.
    - A final FIN/ACK1 exchange signals end of file transfer.
